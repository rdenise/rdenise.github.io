# Pyridoxal 5’-phosphate synthesis and salvage in Bacteria and Archaea: predicting pathway variant distributions and holes

**Pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP)** is a cofactor derived from B6 vitamers and is essential for growth in all known organisms.

PLP synthesis and salvage pathways are well characterized in a few model species, yet key components, such as vitamin B6 transporters, remain unidentified in many organisms, including model bacteria like *Escherichia coli* and *Bacillus subtilis*.

## Overview

Using a comparative genomic approach, we predicted PLP synthesis and salvage pathways in **5840 bacterial and archaeal species** with complete genomes. This comprehensive survey analyzed the distribution of the two known *de novo* biosynthesis pathways and previously identified cases of non-orthologous displacements.

## Key Findings

### De Novo Biosynthesis Pathways
Our analysis confirmed the distribution of the two primary *de novo* pathways:
1.  **DXP-dependent pathway**: Characterized in *E. coli*, involving enzymes like Epd, PdxB, SerC, PdxA, PdxJ, Dxs, and PdxH.
2.  **DXP-independent pathway**: Found in archaea, eukaryotes, and some bacteria (e.g., *B. subtilis*), involving the PdxST enzyme complex.

### Pathway "Holes" and Salvage
*   **Pathway Holes**: We identified that several PLP *de novo* pathway genes remain to be identified in many organisms. These "holes" exist because sequence similarity alone cannot discriminate among homologous candidates or due to non-orthologous displacements.
*   **Salvage Reliance**: Approximately **10%** of the analyzed organisms rely on salvage pathways, necessitating the uptake of B6 vitamers from the environment. However, specific transporters for this process often remain to be identified.

## Implications

This work serves as a starting point to:
*   Model the exchanges of B6 vitamers in microbial communities.
*   Predict the sensitivity of organisms to drugs targeting PLP synthesis enzymes.
*   Identify gaps in knowledge ("holes") that require experimental validation.
