*List of all secretion systems in the type IV filament super-family.*

We create [MacSyfinder](https://github.com/gem-pasteur/macsyfinder) models for genome annotation to identify these secretion systems in publicly accessible genomes. We then analyze their distribution, evolution, and diversification.

We investigate the evolutionary and diverse nature of bacterial secretion systems. Our research involves developing [MacSyfinder models](https://github.com/macsy-models) for genome annotation to identify these secretion systems in publicly available genomes. We then analyze their distribution, evolution, and diversification.

We have created specialized genome annotation tools called [TXSScan](https://github.com/macsy-models/TXSScan) and [TFFScan](https://github.com/macsy-models/TFFscan), which can be used in conjunction with the [MacSyfinder](https://github.com/gem-pasteur/macsyfinder) program. These tools allow us to study the mechanisms that have facilitated the functional diversification of protein secretion systems and related cellular appendages. These systems have evolved to perform various crucial functions, such as motility, adhesion, toxin secretion, and DNA integration.

In 2020, we published a [review article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966842X2030007X?via%3Dihub) that explores the different patterns observed in the evolution of bacterial secretion systems by our team and other researchers.
