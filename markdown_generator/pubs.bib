Using a previously gathered dataset of more than 280 references mentioning a member of the DUF34 (NIF3/Ngg1-interacting Factor 3) family, we evaluated the efficiency of different databases and search tools, and devised a workflow that experimentalists can use to capture the most information published on members of a protein family in the least amount of time. To complement this workflow, web-based platforms allowing for the exploration of protein family members across sequenced genomes or for the analysis of gene neighbourhood information were reviewed for their versatility and ease of use.

   abstract = {The human gut microbiome plays a significant role in health and disease. The viral component (virome) is predominantly composed of bacteriophages (phages) and has received significantly less attention in comparison to the bacteriome. This knowledge gap is largely due to challenges associated with the isolation and characterization of novel gut phages, and bioinformatic hurdles such as the lack of a universal phage marker gene and the absence of sufficient numbers of homologs in viral databases. Here, we describe the isolation from human feces of a novel lytic phage with siphovirus morphology, phiPDS1, infecting Parabacteroides distasonis APCS2/PD, and classified within a newly proposed Sagittacolavirus genus. In silico and biological characterization of this phage is presented in this study. Key to the isolation of phiPDS1 was the antibiotic-driven selective enrichment of the bacterial host in a fecal fermenter. Despite producing plaques and lacking genes associated with lysogeny, phiPDS1 demonstrates the ability to coexist in liquid culture for multiple days without affecting the abundance of its host. Multiple studies have shown that changes in Parabacteroides distasonis abundance can be linked to various disease states, rendering this novel phage-host pair and their interactions of particular interest.},

   abstract = {Protein secretion systems are complex molecular machineries that translocate proteins through the outer membrane and sometimes through multiple other barriers. They have evolved by co-option of components from other envelope-associated cellular machineries, making them sometimes difficult to identify and discriminate. Here, we describe how to identify protein secretion systems in bacterial genomes using the MacSyFinder program. This flexible computational tool uses the knowledge gathered from experimental studies to identify homologous systems in genome data. It can be used with a set of predefined MacSyFinder models, "TXSScan," to identify all major secretion systems of diderm bacteria (i.e., with inner and LPS-containing outer membranes) as well as evolutionarily related cell appendages (pili and flagella). For this, it identifies and clusters co-localized genes encoding proteins of secretion systems using sequence similarity search with Hidden Markov Model (HMM) protein profiles. Finally, it checks if the clusters' genetic content and genomic organization satisfy the constraints of the model. TXSScan models can be altered in the command line or customized to search for variants of known secretion systems. Models can also be built from scratch to identify novel systems. In this chapter, we describe a complete pipeline of analysis, starting from (i) the integration of information from a reference set of experimentally studied systems, (ii) the identification of conserved proteins and the construction of their HMM protein profiles, (iii) the definition and optimization of "macsy-models," and (iv) their use and online distribution as tools to search genomic data for secretion systems of interest. MacSyFinder is available here: https://github.com/gem-pasteur/macsyfinder, and MacSyFinder models here: https://github.com/macsy-models .},

   abstract = {Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate or PLP is a cofactor derived from B(6) vitamers and essential for growth in all known organisms. PLP synthesis and salvage pathways are well characterized in a few model species even though key components, such as the vitamin B(6) transporters, are still to be identified in many organisms including the model bacteria Escherichia coli or Bacillus subtilis . Using a comparative genomic approach, PLP synthesis and salvage pathways were predicted in 5840 bacterial and archaeal species with complete genomes. The distribution of the two known de novo biosynthesis pathways and previously identified cases of non-orthologous displacements were surveyed in the process. This analysis revealed that several PLP de novo pathway genes remain to be identified in many organisms, either because sequence similarity alone cannot be used to discriminate among several homologous candidates or due to non-orthologous displacements. Candidates for some of these pathway holes were identified using published TnSeq data, but many remain. We find that ~10 % of the analysed organisms rely on salvage but further analyses will be required to identify potential transporters. This work is a starting point to model the exchanges of B(6) vitamers in communities, predict the sensitivity of a given organism to drugs targeting PLP synthesis enzymes, and identify numerous gaps in knowledge that will need to be tackled in the years to come.},

   abstract = {Type IV pili (T4P) are dynamic surface appendages that promote virulence, biofilm formation, horizontal gene transfer, and motility in diverse bacterial species. Pilus dynamic activity is best characterized in T4P that use distinct ATPase motors for pilus extension and retraction. Many T4P systems, however, lack a dedicated retraction motor, and the mechanism underlying this motor-independent retraction remains a mystery. Using the Vibrio cholerae competence pilus as a model system, we identify mutations in the major pilin gene that enhance motor-independent retraction. These mutants likely diminish pilin-pilin interactions within the filament to produce less-stable pili. One mutation adds a bulky residue to alpha1C, a universally conserved feature of T4P. We found that inserting a bulky residue into alpha1C of the retraction motor-dependent Acinetobacter baylyi competence T4P enhances motor-independent retraction. Conversely, removing bulky residues from alpha1C of the retraction motor-independent, V. cholerae toxin-coregulated T4P stabilizes the filament and diminishes pilus retraction. Furthermore, alignment of pilins from the broader type IV filament (T4F) family indicated that retraction motor-independent T4P, gram-positive Com pili, and type II secretion systems generally encode larger residues within alpha1C oriented toward the pilus core compared to retraction motor-dependent T4P. Together, our data demonstrate that motor-independent retraction relies, in part, on the inherent instability of the pilus filament, which may be a conserved feature of diverse T4Fs. This provides evidence for a long-standing yet previously untested model in which pili retract in the absence of a motor by spontaneous depolymerization.},

   abstract = {Type IV filaments (T4F), which are helical assemblies of type IV pilins, constitute a superfamily of filamentous nanomachines virtually ubiquitous in prokaryotes that mediate a wide variety of functions. The competence (Com) pilus is a widespread T4F, mediating DNA uptake (the first step in natural transformation) in bacteria with one membrane (monoderms), an important mechanism of horizontal gene transfer. Here, we report the results of genomic, phylogenetic, and structural analyses of ComGC, the major pilin subunit of Com pili. By performing a global comparative analysis, we show that Com pili genes are virtually ubiquitous in Bacilli, a major monoderm class of Firmicutes. This also revealed that ComGC displays extensive sequence conservation, defining a monophyletic group among type IV pilins. We further report ComGC solution structures from two naturally competent human pathogens, Streptococcus sanguinis (ComGC(SS)) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (ComGC(SP)), revealing that this pilin displays extensive structural conservation. Strikingly, ComGC(SS) and ComGC(SP) exhibit a novel type IV pilin fold that is purely helical. Results from homology modeling analyses suggest that the unusual structure of ComGC is compatible with helical filament assembly. Because ComGC displays such a widespread distribution, these results have implications for hundreds of monoderm species.},

   abstract = {Protein secretion is important for many biotic and abiotic interactions. The evolution of protein secretion systems of bacteria, and related nanomachines, occurred by the co-option of machineries for motility, conjugation, injection, or adhesion. Some of these secretion systems emerged many times, whereas others are unique. In most cases, their evolution occurred by successive rounds of gene accretion, deletion, and horizontal transfer, resulting in machines that can be very different from the original ones. The frequency with which such co-option processes occurred seems to depend on the complexity of the systems, their differences to the ancestral machines, the availability of genetic material to tinker with, and possibly on the mechanisms of effector recognition. Understanding the evolution of secretion systems illuminates their functional diversification and could drive the discovery of novel systems.},

   abstract = {Processes of molecular innovation require tinkering and shifting in the function of existing genes. How this occurs in terms of molecular evolution at long evolutionary scales remains poorly understood. Here, we analyse the natural history of a vast group of membrane-associated molecular systems in Bacteria and Archaea-the type IV filament (TFF) superfamily-that diversified in systems involved in flagellar or twitching motility, adhesion, protein secretion, and DNA uptake. The phylogeny of the thousands of detected systems suggests they may have been present in the last universal common ancestor. From there, two lineages-a bacterial and an archaeal-diversified by multiple gene duplications, gene fissions and deletions, and accretion of novel components. Surprisingly, we find that the 'tight adherence' (Tad) systems originated from the interkingdom transfer from Archaea to Bacteria of a system resembling the 'EppA-dependent' (Epd) pilus and were associated with the acquisition of a secretin. The phylogeny and content of ancestral systems suggest that initial bacterial pili were engaged in cell motility and/or DNA uptake. In contrast, specialised protein secretion systems arose several times independently and much later in natural history. The functional diversification of the TFF superfamily was accompanied by genetic rearrangements with implications for genetic regulation and horizontal gene transfer: systems encoded in fewer loci were more frequently exchanged between taxa. This may have contributed to their rapid evolution and spread across Bacteria and Archaea. Hence, the evolutionary history of the superfamily reveals an impressive catalogue of molecular evolution mechanisms that resulted in remarkable functional innovation and specialisation from a relatively small set of components.},
