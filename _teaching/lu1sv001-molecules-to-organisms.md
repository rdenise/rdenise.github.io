### Summary
The objective is to sensitize students to the double feature of diversity and uniqueness of the living world. And a synthetic vision of the modern diversity of life will be presented. The outline of the structure of biodiversity will be identified and the foundations of the methods used for phylogenetic reconstruction are given. The Tree of Life will be so constructed and illustrated by the representation of the main characteristics of organisms of these three domains, Eubacteria, Archaea and Eukaryotes. Beyond this diversity, the basic characteristics of the living world exhibit a remarkable uniqueness, for example membrane structure and protein synthesis. In a first approach, the general organization of the eukaryotic cell, and the major types of macromolecules involved in the formation and functioning of its structures, will be presented.

### Practical sessions
- Study of some model organisms
- The cell: morphology and cytochemistry
- Split Cell
- Chromatographic analysis of a cell extract
