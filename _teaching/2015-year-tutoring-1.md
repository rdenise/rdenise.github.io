Help to understand the following courses for first year bachelor students in Life Sciences at Sorbonne University:

- LV101 -  Molecules to organisms

The objective is to sensitize students to the double feature of diversity and uniqueness of the living world. And a synthetic vision of the modern diversity of life will be presented. The outline of the structure of biodiversity will be identified and the foundations of the methods used for phylogenetic reconstruction are given. The Tree of Life will be so constructed and illustrated by the representation of the main characteristics of organisms of these three domains, Eubacteria, Archaea and Eukaryotes. Beyond this diversity, the basic characteristics of the living world exhibit a remarkable uniqueness, for example membrane structure and protein synthesis. In a first approach, the general organization of the eukaryotic cell, and the major types of macromolecules involved in the formation and functioning of its structures, will be presented.

- LV102 - Diversity of the living

The focus was primarily be on the world of Eukaryotes. The main features of their lifestyles, organization, and reproduction will be discussed for the monophyletic groups such as Metazoans and Embryophytes, as well as for the polyphyletic groups such as Algae and Fungi. The history of life on Earth that led to these major modern groups will be traced, with particular emphasis on extinction and radiation phenomena. Additionally, attention will be given to current biodiversity conservation issues.

- LV103 - Unicity of the living

The purpose is to enable students to acquire fundamental knowledge of current molecular and cellular biology. The structures of biological macromolecules and their functional implications will be studied. The organization and integrated functioning of different compartments of the eukaryotic cell will be presented, as well as the general mechanisms of energy management within the cell and the mechanisms involved in the transmission and expression of genetic information.
