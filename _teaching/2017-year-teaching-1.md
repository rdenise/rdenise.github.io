Graduate Teaching Assistant for the first and second year bachelor students in Life Sciences at Sorbonne University

# LV101 - LU1SV001 -  Molecules to organisms

## Summary:
 
The objective is to sensitize students to the double feature of diversity and uniqueness of the living world. And a synthetic vision of the modern diversity of life will be presented. The outline of the structure of biodiversity will be identified and the foundations of the methods used for phylogenetic reconstruction are given. The Tree of Life will be so constructed and illustrated by the representation of the main characteristics of organisms of these three domains, Eubacteria, Archaea and Eukaryotes. Beyond this diversity, the basic characteristics of the living world exhibit a remarkable uniqueness, for example membrane structure and protein synthesis. In a first approach, the general organization of the eukaryotic cell, and the major types of macromolecules involved in the formation and functioning of its structures, will be presented.
 
## Practical sessions:

- Study of some model organisms
- The cell: morphology and cytochemistry
- Split Cell
- Chromatographic analysis of a cell extract

# LU2SV385 - Programmation for biologists

## Summary:

Introduction to Computer Science introduces the fundamental concepts of programming in the Python language and provides a first approach to basic algorithmic concepts, reusable across all programming languages. It aims to overcome the usual difficulties in understanding computer science in particular and modeling in general. The goal is to provide an introduction to abstraction: what does it mean to represent something in a computer? What does it mean to analyze and categorize a problem? What is a method? How can it be expressed abstractly to be automated? Finally, how can it be implemented in a computer program.

## Program: 

- Simple calculations (booleans, numbers, expressions)
- Imperative principles (variables, instructions, sequences, etc.)
- Functions (definition, application, recursive calculation)
- Notions of algorithmic complexity
- Linear structures (lists/arrays, tuples, sets)
- Complex structures (dictionaries, combinations of structures)
- Introduction to objects
