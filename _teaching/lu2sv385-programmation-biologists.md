### Summary
Introduction to Computer Science introduces the fundamental concepts of programming in the Python language and provides a first approach to basic algorithmic concepts, reusable across all programming languages. It aims to overcome the usual difficulties in understanding computer science in particular and modeling in general. The goal is to provide an introduction to abstraction: what does it mean to represent something in a computer? What does it mean to analyze and categorize a problem? What is a method? How can it be expressed abstractly to be automated? Finally, how can it be implemented in a computer program.

### Program
- Simple calculations (booleans, numbers, expressions)
- Imperative principles (variables, instructions, sequences, etc.)
- Functions (definition, application, recursive calculation)
- Notions of algorithmic complexity
- Linear structures (lists/arrays, tuples, sets)
- Complex structures (dictionaries, combinations of structures)
- Introduction to objects
