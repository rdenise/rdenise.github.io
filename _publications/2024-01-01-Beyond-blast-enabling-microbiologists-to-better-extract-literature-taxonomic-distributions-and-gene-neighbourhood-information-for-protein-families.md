"Beyond Blast" refers to a published workflow designed to assist microbiologists in more effectively extracting literature, taxonomic distributions, and gene neighborhood information for protein families. This approach aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of protein families beyond what traditional BLAST analyses offer. The workflow was developed and evaluated using a dataset of over 280 references related to the DUF34 protein family. The researchers assessed the efficiency of various databases and search tools to create a method that helps experimentalists capture the most relevant published information on protein families in the shortest time.
