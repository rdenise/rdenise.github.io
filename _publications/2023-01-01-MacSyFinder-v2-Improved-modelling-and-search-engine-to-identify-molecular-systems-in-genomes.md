MacSyFinder v2 is a major release of the Macromolecular System Finder program, designed to model and annotate complex cellular functions in microbial genomes by identifying individual genes at the molecular system level. The updated version is coded in Python 3 and features improved, rationalized code for better maintainability and more flexible system modeling. The new release introduces a more intuitive and comprehensive search engine capable of identifying optimal and sub-optimal candidate systems that adhere to model constraints. Additionally, MacSyFinder v2 includes a novel companion tool called `macsydata`, which facilitates the easy installation and broad distribution of models developed for MacSyFinder (macsy-models) from GitHub repositories.
