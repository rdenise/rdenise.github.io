A novel lytic bacteriophage, designated phiPDS1 (φPDS1), which infects Parabacteroides distasonis, has been successfully isolated and characterized from human feces. This discovery contributes to a better understanding of the viral component of the human gut microbiome. phiPDS1 exhibits siphovirus morphology and has been classified within a newly proposed genus, Sagittacolavirus. The phage is lytic, meaning it replicates within and then lyses its host bacterial cells. Despite its lytic nature, phiPDS1 has demonstrated an ability to coexist with its host in liquid culture for several days without impacting the host's abundance.
