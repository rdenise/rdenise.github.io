Process of molecular innovation require tinkering and the co-option of existing genes. But this process remains poorly understood on long evolutionary scales. During this thesis, I analyzed the evolutionary history of a large group of molecular membrane systems associated with bacteria and archaea - the superfamily of type IV filaments (TFF-SF) - that have diversified into systems involved in flagellar or contraction motility, adhesion, protein secretion, natural transformation.... I have developed tools and methods that have allowed me to identify these systems in all phyla of two of the kingdoms of life, and their phylogeny suggests that they may have been present in the last universal common ancestor. TFF-SF was then diversified by multiple gene duplications, fission of the gene from the integral membrane platform, and accretion of new components. Surprisingly, I found that Tad systems originated from the interkingdom transfer from Archaea to Bacteria of a system similar to the Epd pilus. The phylogeny and the content of ancestral systems suggest that the initial bacterial pili were involved in cellular motility and/or DNA transformation. On the other hand, specialized protein secretion systems appeared much later. All these processes of functional diversification have been accompanied by genetic rearrangements with implications for genetic regulation and horizontal gene transfer. Overall, the evolutionary history of TFF-SF reveals an impressive catalogue of the variety of molecular mechanisms involved in the origin of new functions through tinkering and co-optation of cellular machineries.
