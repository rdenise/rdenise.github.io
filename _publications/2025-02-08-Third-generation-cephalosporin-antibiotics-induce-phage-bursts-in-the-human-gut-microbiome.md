Third-generation cephalosporin antibiotics are widely used but can disrupt the gut microbiome. This study investigates their impact on phage populations in the human gut. We found that these antibiotics induce phage bursts, particularly of temperate phages, which may play a role in the recovery of the gut microbiota diversity after antibiotic treatment.
